# What is Node Package Manager (NPM)?

**Node Package Manager (NPM)** is the default package manager for **Node.js**, which is a runtime environment for running JavaScript code on the server-side. NPM is essential for managing external libraries (or **packages**) that developers need in their applications.

### Key Functions of NPM:
1. **Package Management**:
   - NPM allows you to install, update, and manage external libraries or Node.js modules.
   - Example: `npm install express` installs the Express.js framework.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - It helps manage project dependencies by tracking them in the `package.json` file.
   - This file stores the project’s dependencies, their versions, and custom scripts.

3. **NPM Registry**:
   - NPM connects to an online registry with thousands of open-source libraries.
   - Developers can publish their own packages for others to use.

4. **Running Scripts**:
   - NPM allows you to run scripts (e.g., starting a server, running tests).
   - Example: `npm start` runs a defined script, often to start the application.

### Common NPM Commands:
- `npm install` or `npm i`: Installs all the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
- `npm install <package_name>`: Installs a specific package.
- `npm update`: Updates installed packages.
- `npm uninstall <package_name>`: Uninstalls a package.
- `npm publish`: Publishes your own package to the NPM registry.

### Alternative Package Manager:
- **Yarn**: Another package manager for Node.js that is faster and more secure, but still uses the same NPM registry.

# What are Packages?

In simple terms, **packages** are bundles of code created by others that you can reuse in your own projects to avoid writing the same code from scratch.

### Key Points:
- A **package** is like an **app** for your project that adds new functionality or tools.
- You can **install packages** from NPM to add these features to your project.
- Packages save time and effort by providing pre-written solutions for common problems.

### Example:
Let’s say you are building a web app and need to create a server. Instead of writing all the server code from scratch, you can install the **Express** package, which simplifies the process.

### Common Packages:
1. **Express**: Helps build web servers easily.
2. **Lodash**: Provides utility functions for working with arrays, objects, strings, etc.
3. **Axios**: Helps make HTTP requests, such as fetching data from APIs.

# What Type of Requests Does Express Handle?

**Express** is a web framework for Node.js, and it handles various **HTTP requests** between the **client and the server**. Express manages both **incoming requests** from the client and **sending responses** back to the client.

### Common Requests Express Handles:
1. **GET**:
   - Retrieves data from the server (e.g., when a user visits a webpage).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
         res.send('Fetching all users');
     });
     ```

2. **POST**:
   - Sends data to the server to create a new resource (e.g., submitting a form).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
         res.send('Creating a new user');
     });
     ```

3. **PUT**:
   - Updates existing data on the server.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     app.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
         res.send(`Updating user with id ${req.params.id}`);
     });
     ```

4. **DELETE**:
   - Deletes data from the server.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     app.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
         res.send(`Deleting user with id ${req.params.id}`);
     });
     ```

5. **PATCH**:
   - Partially updates data on the server.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     app.patch('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
         res.send(`Partially updating user with id ${req.params.id}`);
     });
     ```

# What Type of Requests Does Axios Handle?

**Axios** is a **client-side** library (but can also be used server-side) that makes **HTTP requests** to a server or an API.

### Common Requests Axios Handles:
1. **GET**:
   - Retrieves data from a server (fetching API data).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     axios.get('https://api.example.com/users')
       .then(response => {
           console.log(response.data);
       });
     ```

2. **POST**:
   - Sends data to the server to create a new resource (like submitting a form).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     axios.post('https://api.example.com/users', {
         name: 'John',
         age: 30
     }).then(response => {
         console.log(response.data);
     });
     ```

3. **PUT**:
   - Updates existing data on the server.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     axios.put('https://api.example.com/users/1', {
         name: 'John Updated',
         age: 31
     }).then(response => {
         console.log(response.data);
     });
     ```

4. **DELETE**:
   - Deletes data from the server.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     axios.delete('https://api.example.com/users/1')
       .then(response => {
           console.log('User deleted');
       });
     ```

5. **PATCH**:
   - Partially updates a resource on the server.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     axios.patch('https://api.example.com/users/1', {
         age: 32
     }).then(response => {
         console.log(response.data);
     });
     ```

# Summary: Express vs Axios

- **Express**: 
  - Handles server-side HTTP requests between the **client and the server**.
  - Used to create APIs and web servers.
  
- **Axios**:
  - Primarily used on the **client-side** to make HTTP requests to servers or APIs.
  - Can also be used on the **server-side** to make requests from one server to another.



# Clarification of the Roles of Express and Axios

### **Express (Server-Side)**:
- **Express** is primarily used on the **server** (backend).
- It handles requests **from the client to the server** and sends responses **from the server to the client**.
- When a client (like a browser or a frontend app) makes a request (such as visiting a webpage or submitting a form), Express processes that request and sends back the appropriate response (like HTML, JSON, etc.).

### **Simplified Flow of Express**:
1. **Client → Server (Request)**:
   - The client (like a browser or frontend app) makes a request to the server. For example, when you visit a webpage or make an API call (like `/users`), this is a **GET request** sent to the Express server.
   
2. **Server → Client (Response)**:
   - Express processes this request and sends data back to the client (for example, user data, a webpage, or confirmation that something was updated).

---

### **Axios (Client-Side, and sometimes Server-Side)**:
- **Axios** is typically used on the **client-side** (frontend) to make **HTTP requests** to a server. It’s often used in **browser-based apps** (such as React, Vue, etc.) to get or post data to a server or an API.
  
  **Client → Server**:
   - Axios sends requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to an external server or API to fetch or send data.
   
  **Server → Client**:
   - Axios receives the response from the server (such as data in JSON format) and allows you to use it in your frontend app.

**However**, Axios can also be used on the **server-side** within a Node.js application (even inside an Express app). This is useful when your server needs to make requests to **other servers** (like calling third-party APIs from your backend).

---

### **Example: Using Axios on the Server (Inside an Express App)**

Here's an example of how Axios can be used on the **server** (inside an Express app) to make requests to other APIs:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();

app.get('/data-from-api', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    res.send(response.data);  // Send data back to the client
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error fetching data');
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

```

# Why Use Axios When Express Handles Requests and Responses?

### **Express (Server-Side Framework)**:
- **Express** handles **server-side requests** from **clients** (like browsers or frontend apps) and sends **responses** back to the clients.
- It’s not designed to **initiate outgoing requests** to other servers or APIs. Instead, it mainly handles routing, middleware, and building APIs.

### **Axios (Client-Side and Server-Side HTTP Client)**:
- **Axios** is used to make **HTTP requests** to external servers or APIs, either from the **client-side** (frontend apps) or **server-side** (backend apps like Express).
- Axios allows you to make requests to fetch data, send data, or perform CRUD operations on another API or server.

---

### **How Express and Axios Differ**:

| | **Express** | **Axios** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Web framework used to build APIs and handle incoming requests. | HTTP client for making outgoing requests to APIs or servers. |
| **Primary Use** | Used to create routes, middleware, and handle requests/responses in Node.js. | Used to send **outgoing HTTP requests** (GET, POST, etc.) to external APIs or servers. |
| **Scope** | Server-side only (backend). | Client-side and server-side (in Node.js) to fetch/send data. |

---

### **Why Axios is Needed in Addition to Express**:

1. **Server-to-Server Communication**:
   - Express doesn't make **outgoing requests**. You need **Axios** (or similar libraries) to fetch data from external APIs or servers.
   - Example: Your Express server needs to fetch weather data from a third-party API.

2. **Client-Side Communication**:
   - **Axios** is commonly used on the **client-side** to communicate with a backend (like an Express server) by sending **HTTP requests**.
   - Example: Axios is used in React to send a request to your Express API to fetch or send data.

3. **Abstraction & Convenience**:
   - Axios provides an easy-to-use API, handles **promises** and **async/await**, automatically parses JSON responses, and manages HTTP headers and errors.
   - Compared to Node’s `http/https` modules, Axios is more user-friendly for making HTTP requests.

4. **Client and Server Usage**:
   - Axios can be used **on both the client-side and the server-side** in Node.js applications, providing flexibility in making HTTP requests.

---

### **Example: Server-to-Server Request Using Axios in Express**:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();

app.get('/weather', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Axios makes an outgoing request to a weather API
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.weather.com/v3/weather');
    res.send(response.data);  // Send weather data back to the client
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error fetching weather data');
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```
