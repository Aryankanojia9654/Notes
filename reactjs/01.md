# Notes on `npx create-react-app` and Vite Setup

## Differences Between `npx create-react-app` and Vite (`npm create vite@latest`)

### 1. File Structure

#### **`npx create-react-app` File Structure:**
- **Public Folder:**
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file where the React app gets injected.
  - Static assets (e.g., images, favicons) used in the app.
- **Src Folder:**
  - `index.js` or `index.jsx`: The main entry point for the JavaScript code, which renders the app.
  - `App.js` or `App.jsx`: Main React component that structures the app.
  - Additional components, styles, and tests will be created here.
- **Other Files:**
  - `package.json`: Lists dependencies and includes scripts for running, building, and testing the app.
  - `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `node_modules`: Configuration files and installed dependencies.

#### **Vite File Structure:**
- **Public Folder:** Similar to `create-react-app` but generally lighter.
- **Src Folder:**
  - `main.jsx`: The main entry point where the React app is rendered.
  - `App.jsx`: The main React component file.
- **index.html:** Directly includes a `<script>` tag that loads JavaScript (`<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>`).
- **package.json:** Similar structure but lighter than `create-react-app`.
- **Vite Configuration:** Less configuration is needed, making it faster and more lightweight.

### 2. Why Different Naming Conventions?

#### **`npx create-react-app`:**
- Uses the command `npx create-react-app <project-name>` to set up a new React app.
- Allows components to be created in either `.js` or `.jsx` files.
- JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript.

#### **Vite:**
- Uses `npm create vite@latest <project-name>` to scaffold the project.
- Enforces stricter rules, such as using `.jsx` for React components and requiring capitalized component names (e.g., `App` instead of `app`).
- Vite supports other frameworks too, but when used with React, it's optimized for fast development with ES modules.

### 3. React DOM and Rendering

#### **React DOM in `create-react-app`:**
- React uses `ReactDOM.createRoot()` to create the root of the app.
- The root is attached to a specific HTML element (usually `<div id="root"></div>`).
  
```js
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

#### JSX and Custom Tags:
1. JSX allows custom tags like **<App />**, which represent React components.
2. JSX elements must be wrapped in a single parent element, either a <div> or a React Fragment (<> </>).
```jsx
Copy code
return (
  <>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is a React app.</p>
  </>
);
```


### 4. How JavaScript is Included in React ***(create-react-app)***
1. In create-react-app, JavaScript files are bundled by Webpack, and scripts are automatically injected into index.html during the build process.

2. pakage.json of Vite project:
```jsx
"dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
}
```
####  this ```"react-scripts": "5.0.1"``` are responsible for the reload of the js,

```
3. You don’t manually add ```<script> tags in the HTML. Webpack handles it behind the scenes.```
4. The necessary scripts are defined in package.json (under react-scripts), which manages the app's start, build, and test processes.
 ```json 
 "scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test"
}
```

### 5. Script Inclusion in Vite
1. Vite directly includes a ***<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>*** in index.html.
This ensures the browser loads the main JavaScript file (like main.jsx) as a module, without the need for Webpack bundling during development.

```html
Copy code
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
```

2. pakage.json of Vite project:
```jsx
"dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
}
```

This approach is faster, as Vite uses ES modules and skips heavy bundling during development, leading to faster builds and hot module replacement (HMR).

### 6. JSX and Capitalization Rules
1. JSX Requirements:
JSX code must be enclosed in a single parent element like a <div> or React Fragment (<> </>).
```jsx
Copy code
return (
  <>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>React is awesome!</p>
  </>
);
```

2. Capitalization of Component Names:
Both in create-react-app and Vite, React components must start with an uppercase letter (e.g., App instead of app). Lowercase names are interpreted as HTML tags.

### 7. Scripts in package.json
1. Both create-react-app and Vite store commands to manage the app's lifecycle in package.json.

Example from create-react-app:
```json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test"
}
```
2. Example from Vite:
```json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```
These scripts are essential for running, building, and deploying the project.

# Key Learnings

1. **JSX and Custom Tags:**
   - JSX allows writing HTML-like code directly in JavaScript. Custom tags like `<App />` represent React components, which are JavaScript functions that return JSX.

2. **ReactDOM Rendering:**
   - React renders the app by targeting a root element in the `index.html` file. This is done using `ReactDOM.createRoot()` and `root.render(<App />)`.

3. **Script Handling:**
   - In `create-react-app`, scripts are injected into the HTML by Webpack during the build process. You don’t manually add `<script>` tags.
   - In Vite, the script for the JavaScript entry point is explicitly added to `index.html` using a `<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>` tag.

4. **Stricter Rules in Vite:**
   - Vite enforces stricter rules, such as using `.jsx` for component files and capitalizing component names. It also requires that JSX code is wrapped in a single parent element like a `<div>` or a fragment (`<> </>`).

5. **Component Naming and Structure:**
   - In both `create-react-app` and Vite, React components must be capitalized, and JSX elements should be enclosed in a parent element.

6. **Performance in Vite:**
   - Vite is faster than `create-react-app` because it uses ES modules and skips bundling during development. This results in faster hot module replacement (HMR) and a more lightweight setup.
